#  Ant and Triangle Problem

## Problem Statement
- Three ants are sitting at the three corners of an equilateral triangle. Each ant starts randomly picks a direction and starts to move along the edge of the triangle. What is the probability that none of the ants collide?

- Ants need to all move in the save direction to avoid collision.
- Either Clockwise or Counter Clockwise. One in two chance for movement direction.
- So, (0.5^3) x 2 = 0.25.
