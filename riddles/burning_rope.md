# Burning Rope Timer

## Problem Statement
- A man has two ropes of varying thickness (Those two ropes are not identical, they aren’t the same density nor the same length nor the same width). Each rope burns in 60 minutes. He actually wants to measure 45 mins. How can he measure 45 mins using only these two ropes.
He can’t cut the one rope in half because the ropes are non-homogeneous and he can’t be sure how long it will burn.

### Solution
1. Burn the 1st rope at both ends and the 2nd rope at one end.
2. In 30 min the 1st rope will have burned completely. Now burn the other
end of the 2nd rope.
3. It will take 15 minutes for the 2nd rope to burn completely.
4. 30 min + 15 min = 45 min.
