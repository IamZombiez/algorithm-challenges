# 10 Coins- Head and Tails

# Problem Statement
- You are blindfolded and 10 coins are place in front of you on table. You are allowed to touch the coins, but canâ€™t tell which way up they are by feel. You are told that there are 5 coins head up, and 5 coins tails up but not which ones are which.
- How do you make two piles of coins each with the same number of heads up? You can flip the coins any number of times.

## Solution
- Divide the coins into two piles of five.
- Flip all the coins one of the piles once.
- You will now have a matching number of heads in each pile.


| Pile One (Unfliped) | Pile Two (Unfliped) | Pile One (Flipped) | Pile Two (Flipped) |
| :------: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: |
| H T T T T | T H H H H | T H H H H | H T T T T |
| H H T T T| T T H H H | T T H H H | H H T T T |

- If you flip the coins in Pile One **( T H H H H )**, it will match the unflipped coins in Pile Two **( T H H H H )**.
- The same occurs if you flip Pile Two **( H T T T T )**, it will match the unflipped coins in Pile One **( H T T T T )**.
