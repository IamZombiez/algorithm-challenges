# 10 Coins- Head and Tails

# Problem Statement
- You are blindfolded and 10 coins are place in front of you on table. You are allowed to touch the coins, but canâ€™t tell which way up they are by feel. You are told that there are 5 coins head up, and 5 coins tails up but not which ones are which.
- How do you make two piles of coins each with the same number of heads up? You can flip the coins any number of times.

## Solution
- Divide the coins into two piles of five.
- Flip all the coins one of the piles once.
- You will now have a matching number of heads in each pile.

| Pile One (Unfliped) | Pile Two (Unfliped) | Pile One (Flipped) | Pile Two (Flipped) |
