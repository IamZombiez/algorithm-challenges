# 10 Coins - Head and Tails

# Problem Statement
- You are blindfolded and 10 coins are place in front of you on table. You are allowed to touch the coins, but canâ€™t tell which way up they are by feel. You are told that there are 5 coins head up, and 5 coins tails up but not which ones are which.
- How do you make two piles of coins each with the same number of heads up? You can flip the coins any number of times.

## Solution
- Divide the coins into two piles of five.
- Flip all the coins one of the piles once.
- You will now have a matching number of heads in each pile.

## Pile One Flipped

| Pile One (Unflipped) | Pile Two (Unflipped) | Pile One (Flipped) |
| :------: | :-----: | :-----: |
| H T T T T | T H H H H | T H H H H |
| H H T T T| T T H H H | T T H H H |

## Pile Two Flipped

| Pile Two (Unflipped) | Pile One (Unflipped) | Pile Two (Flipped) |
| :------: | :-----: | :-----: |
| T H H H H | H T T T T | H T T T T |
| T T H H H| H H T T T | H H T T T |

- If you flip the coins in Pile One **( T H H H H )**, it will match the unflipped coins in Pile Two **( T H H H H )**.
- The same occurs if you flip Pile Two **( H T T T T )**, it will match the unflipped coins in Pile One **( H T T T T )**.
- Second Example: Flipped Pile One **( T T H H H )**, Unflipped Pile Two **( T T H H H )**


## Scaled Up Heads and Tails
- If we're given 100 coins, and 10 of them are heads.
- Solve to make an equal number of heads in each pile.
- We simply need to take 10 coins, as our first pile and flip them. The remaining 90 are left alone.
- We can solve any variation as long as we make the size of the first pile equal to the number of declared Heads up coins and flip them.
