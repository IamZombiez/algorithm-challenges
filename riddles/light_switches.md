# Three Light Switches

## Problem:
- You’re in a room with three light switches, each of which controls one of three light bulbs in the next room. You need to determine which switch controls which bulb. All lights are off to begin, and you can’t see into one room from the other. You can inspect the other room only once. How can you find out which switches are connected to which bulbs?

## Solution
- Leave **Switch One** off.
- Turn on **Switch Two**, leave it on for 10-15 min or more.
- Turn off **Switch Two**. Turn on Switch 3.
- Cold Light Bulb is One, Warm Light Bulb is Two. The light currently on is Three.
