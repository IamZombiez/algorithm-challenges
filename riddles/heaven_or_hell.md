# Heaven or Hell

## Problem Statement
- You are standing before two doors. One of the path leads to heaven and the other one leads to hell. There are two guardians, one by each door. You know one of them always tells the truth and the other always lies, but you donâ€™t know who is the honest one and who is the liar.
- You can only ask one question to one of them in order to find the way to heaven. What is the question?

### Solution
- You should ask is "**If I ask the other guard about which side leads to heaven, what would he answer?.**"


#### Explanation (Assume Left is the Door to Heaven)
- you take the opposite door of the answer given. If right is given you would take the left door. The door to hell will always be pointed to.
- The honest guard would point to the door to Hell because the honest guard would know that the liar would not point to the door to Heaven.
- The lying guard would point to the door to Hell because the lying guard would know that the honest guard would point to Heaven, and would therefore lie about it and point to the Hell doorway.
