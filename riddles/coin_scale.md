# Coins and a Scale

## Problem Statement

- You have eight coins and a two-pan scale. All the coins weigh the same, except for one which is heavier than all the others. The coins are otherwise indistinguishable. You may make no assumptions about how much heavier the heavy coin is. What is the minimum number of weighings needed to be certain of identifying the heavy coin?

### Solution
1. Split into two groups of three. One group of 2.
2. Weigh two groups of three, if equal coin is in the group of two.
3. if not equal, take the heavier set of three and weigh two coins, if both those are equal its the coin that was set aside.

## You can find the heavier coin in **2 Weighings**
