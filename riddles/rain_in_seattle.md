# It's Always Raining in Seattle

# Problem:
- You’re about to get on a plane to Seattle. You want to know if it’s raining.
- You call 3 random friends who live there and ask each if it’s raining.
- Each friend has a 2/3 chance of telling you the truth and a 1/3 chance of messing with you by lying.
- All 3 friends tell you that “Yes” it is raining. What is the probability that it’s actually raining in Seattle?

## Solution
- We know that it only takes one friend telling us the truth for it to be raining. Calculating the odds of lying is faster.
- Each friend has a 1/3 chance of lying. so 1/27 chance that all three are lying.
- Leaving us 26/27 chance that one of them told the truth.
- **~96% chance** it's raining in Seattle.
